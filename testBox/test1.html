                    <h1>Early Life of Monroe</h1>

                    <p>In January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.[19]
                        After
                        several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital.[20] She
                        spent
                        the
                        rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe.[21] Monroe
                        became a
                        ward
                        of the state, and her mother's friend, Grace Goddard, took responsibility over her and her
                        mother's
                        affairs.[22]</p>

                    <h1>Summary of her Life</h1>
                    <p>Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 4, 1962) was an American
                        actress
                        and
                        model.
                        Famous for playing comedic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most popular sex
                        symbols
                        of
                        the 1950s and early
                        1960s and was emblematic of the era's sexual revolution. She was a top-billed actress for a
                        decade,
                        and
                        her
                        films grossed $200
                        million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021) by the time of her death in 1962.[3] Long after her
                        death,
                        Monroe
                        remains a major icon
                        of pop culture.[4] In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the
                        greatest
                        female screen legends
                        from the Golden Age of Hollywood.</p>
